/// # Component manifest (`.cml`) reference
///
/// A `.cml` file contains a single json5 object literal with the keys below.
///
/// Where string values are expected, a list of valid values is generally documented.
/// The following string value types are reused and must follow specific rules.
///
/// The `.cml` file is compiled into a FIDL wire format (`.cm`) file.
///
/// ## String types
///
/// ### Names {#names}
///
/// Both capabilities and a component's children are named. A name string may
/// consist of one or more of the following characters: `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`,
/// `_`, `.`, `-`. It must not exceed 255 characters in length and may not start
/// with `.` or `-`.
///
/// ### Paths {#paths}
///
/// Paths are sequences of [names](#names) delimited by the `/` character. A path
/// must not exceed 4095 characters in length. Throughout the document,
///
/// - Relative paths cannot start with the `/` character.
/// - Namespace and outgoing directory paths must start with the `/` character.
///
/// ### References {#references}
///
/// A reference string takes the form of `#<name>`, where `<name>` refers to the name of a child:
///
/// - A [static child instance][doc-static-children] whose name is
///     `<name>`, or
/// - A [collection][doc-collections] whose name is `<name>`.

    ///
    /// ```json5
    /// include: [ "syslog/client.shard.cml" ]
    /// ```
    ///
    /// In the example given above, the component manifest is including contents from a
    /// manifest shard provided by the `syslog` library, thus ensuring that the
    /// component functions correctly at runtime if it attempts to write to `syslog`. By
    /// convention such files are called "manifest shards" and end with `.shard.cml`.
    ///
    /// Include paths prepended with `//` are relative to the source root of the Fuchsia
    /// checkout. However, include paths not prepended with `//`, as in the example
    /// above, are resolved from Fuchsia SDK libraries (`//sdk/lib`) that export
    /// component manifest shards.
    ///
    /// For reference, inside the Fuchsia checkout these two include paths are
    /// equivalent:
    ///
    /// * `syslog/client.shard.cml`
    /// * `//sdk/lib/syslog/client.shard.cml`
    ///
    /// You can review the outcome of merging any and all includes into a component
    /// manifest file by invoking the following command:
    ///
    /// Note: The `fx` command below is for developers working in a Fuchsia source
    /// checkout environment.
    ///
    /// ```sh
    /// fx cmc include {{ "<var>" }}cml_file{{ "</var>" }} --includeroot $FUCHSIA_DIR --includepath $FUCHSIA_DIR/sdk/lib
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Includes can cope with duplicate [`use`], [`offer`], [`expose`], or [`capabilities`]
    /// declarations referencing the same capability, as long as the properties are the same. For
    /// example:
    ///
    /// ```json5
    /// // my_component.cml
    /// include: [ "syslog.client.shard.cml" ]
    /// use: [
    ///     {
    ///         protocol: [
    ///             "fuchsia.posix.socket.Provider",

    /// // syslog.client.shard.cml
    /// use: [
    ///     { protocol: "fuchsia.logger.LogSink" },
    /// ],
    /// ```
    ///
    /// In this example, the contents of the merged file will be the same as my_component.cml --
    /// `fuchsia.logger.LogSink` is deduped.
    ///
    /// However, this would fail to compile:
    ///
    /// ```json5
    /// // my_component.cml
    /// include: [ "syslog.client.shard.cml" ]
    /// use: [
    ///     {
