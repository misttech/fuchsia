Name: protobuf-py3

Description:
These are protoc-generated source files produced by following
these instructions: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/main/python#building-packages-from-this-repo

As a special case, these files are extracted from the wheel file coming
from the following package: infra/python/wheel/protobuf-py3.

The infra code for building this package is in:
https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/main/infra/tools/dockerbuild/
https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/main/infra/tools/dockerbuild/wheels.py#2528

Builders are https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/infra-internal/g/wheel_builders/builders

The extraction script is in \$FUCHSIA_DIR/tools/build/scripts, and invoked
as a Jiri hook.

To update to a new version:

1) Modify the "version" attribute of the "<package>" element called
   "protobuf-py3" in \$FUCHSIA_DIR/manifest/prebuilts

2) Run: \$FUCHSIA_DIR/manifests/update-lockfiles.sh
   This verifies that the version exists and updates critical Jiri files.

3) Run: jiri update -local-manifest-project=fuchsia
   This installs the new wheel file to \$FUCHSIA_DIR/${SOURCE_SUBDIR}
   then runs a hook to update \$FUCHSIA_DIR/${DEST_SUBDIR}

4) Verify that everything works

5) Update new CL to Gerrit with your modifications.
