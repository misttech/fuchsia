// (i.e. libc.a or libc.so) part in program startup: immediately after the
// [_start](crt1.S) code, possibly after a startup or remote dynamic linker.
// It's called the startup trampoline because it "bounces" from phase one
// (basic machine ABI) to phase two (full Fuchsia Compiler ABI on new stacks):
// from the first (assembly) [`__libc_start_main`](startup-trampoline.S) to the
// second (C++) [`__libc_start_main`](start-main.cc).

// This is the full signature of the `main` function as it's actually called by
// Unix tradition.  The C standard actually allows either of two signatures for
// the application's main function, and neither of them is this one.  It allows
// zero arguments or two, but passing a third argument is always harmless in
// all the calling conventions actually in use (just like passing the first two
// the standard specifies is harmless to the allowed zero-argument definition).
//
// It can't be checked by CFI.  Even if it were assumed in the given libc build
// that every user's main function will necessarily have been compiled with CFI
// instrumentation, there are three different valid signatures the user might
// have used; but CFI will require that it match the single one declared here.

// independent of the bootstrap protocol details.  It is entered using the
// basic machine ABI and calls StartCompilerAbi (below), but then acts as a
// tail call to the namespaced __libc_start_main (declared in start-main.h).
//
// Both functions have the same name in the source and thus as rendered in
// backtraces with debugging symbols so that, at least by plain function name,
// every point in startup should show _start -> __libc_start_main -> ... in a
// backtrace whether in the initial phase or when -> ... is -> main -> ...
