// ThreadStorage handles the memory allocation and ownership for Thread.  It's
// responsible for allocating all the various kinds of stacks, and the thread
// area that underlies both the implementation's private Thread Control Block
// (TCB) as well as the public Fuchsia Compiler ABI and ELF TLS.  ThreadStorage
// initializes only the parts of the TCB that are part of the public ABI
// (including all of ELF Initial Exec TLS) and then leaves the rest of the TCB
// zero-initialized for later use by libc internals.
//
// Initially it's used at process startup and thread creation.  It owns those
// allocations and cleans them up on destruction e.g. if thread creation fails.
// During the thread's lifetime, the ThreadStorage is moved into its Thread.
// This is a bit tricky, as the Thread object's own memory resides in one of
// the blocks that ThreadStorage owns.  So to destroy Thread, its ThreadStorage
// must be moved back out before explicitly calling ~Thread().
//
// ThreadStorage can only be default-constructed or moved.  Before Allocate()
// has returned successfully (or after it fails), it should only be destroyed
// and no other methods used (except for moves).

  // The machine stack, unsafe stack (for the SafeStack ABI, enabled on all
  // machines), and shadow call stack (enabled on some machines), are all
  // allocated with guard pages and all-zeroes contents.  In the thread area:
  //
  //  * The unsafe stack pointer at $tp + ZX_TLS_UNSAFE_SP_OFFSET is set to
  //    the top of the unsafe stack.
  //
  //  * If the machine's TLS ABI has *$tp = $tp (like x86), that is set.
  //
  //  * The ZX_TLS_STACK_GUARD_OFFSET word still must be set.  For the initial
  //    thread, the caller will choose random bits; for new threads, the caller
  //    will copy the value found via its own $tp.
  //
  //  * All the ELF Initial Exec TLS data (static TLS) is initialized.
  //
  //  * The DTV for the dynamic TLS implementation is allocated and filled in.
  //    TODO(https://fxbug.dev/397084454): The new //sdk/lib/dl TLS runtime
  //    does not require a bespoke ABI contract for a DTV.

  // primary allocation / root VMAR handle, except in tests).

  // by this ThreadStorage object, which also contains the static TLS area
  // already initialized with all the Initial Exec TLS data.  The ABI rules
  // govern where that is in relation to the thread pointer ($tp) and thereby,
  // indirectly, where the TCB lies relative to $tp.  (Note that here we
  // consider the Fuchsia Compiler ABI <zircon/tls.h> fixed slots, as well as
  // the $tp->self pointer on x86, to be part of the TCB--at one end of it or
