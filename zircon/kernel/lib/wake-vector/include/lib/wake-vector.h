// WakeEvent manages the lifecycle of wake events triggered by wake vectors.
//
// A system wake event may be triggered in response to an appropriately configured interrupt,
// exception, timer, or other future wake source that should resume the system from a suspended
// state. When a wake event is triggered, it enters the pending state and will prevent the system
// from entering suspend until it has been acknowledged. A pending wake event is automatically
// acknowledged when the WakeEvent instance is destroyed to prevent missing an acknowledgement that
// would render the system unable to suspend.
//
// WakeEvent maintains a global list of all instances for diagnostic purposes (i.e. logging wake
// events that pending before, during, and after suspend). WakeEvents are added to and removed from
// the global list using WakeEvent::Initialize and WakeEvent::Destroy, respectively. Because
// diagnostics access each WakeEvent, and its containing WakeVector, from the global list, care must
// be taken to avoid potential use-after-free hazards.
//
// Users of WakeEvents MUST adhere to the following rules:
// 1. A WakeEvent object MUST be instantiated as a member of a type that implements the WakeVector
//    interface, such that the lifetime of the containing type encoloses the lifetime of the
//    WakeEvent. DO NOT heap allocate WakeEvent instances separately from the referenced WakeVector.
// 2. The container of a WakeEvent instance SHOULD call WakeEvent::Initialize during construction /
//    initialization to register the WakeEvent on the global list. The container MAY skip the call
//    to WakeEvent::Initialize if initialization of the containing type fails.
// 3. The container of a WakeEvent MUST call WakeEvent::Destroy IFF WakeEvent::Initialize has been
//    called previously on the same instance of WakeEvent AND WakeEvent::Destroy MUST be called
//    BEFORE the containing type itself is destructed.
//
// WakeEvent::Destroy MAY be called in the destructor of the containing type, which will ensure that
// the WakeEvent is removed from the global list before any state in the containing type that
// diagnostics may access becomes invalid. However, extra care must be taken if a WakeEvent is a
// member of a base class and there are subclasses that override WakeVector::GetDiagnostics -- in
// these cases the subclass is responsible for calling WakeEvent::Destroy before its destructor
// completes INSTEAD of the base class to prevent use-after-free during races between diagnostics
// and the destruction of subclass state that diagnostics might access.
//
// AS A GENERAL RULE, it is safe to call WakeEvent::Initialize in a constructor and
// WakeEvent::Destroy in a destructor IF the destructor OR the implementation/override of
// WakeVector::GetDiagnostics can be marked final in the class making the calls.
//
// Calls to WakeEvent::Initialize and WakeEvent::Destroy must always be balanced. However, a
// WakeEvent MAY be initialized and destroyed more than once, as long as it is destroyed before its
// destructor is invoked.

  // Notes on the pending list, locks, and concurrency.  You definitely want to
  // read this if you are reading the wake source reporting generation code.  It
  // will provide an explanation about how this all works, why it is structured
  // the way it is, and why it is all safe.
  //
  // It is a requirement that every wake source in the system which has become
  // signaled since last being reported be present in any wake source report
  // generated for a caller of `zx_system_suspend_enter`.  They will continue to
  // be reported to users until they have been *both* acknowledged, and reported
  // at least once.
  //
  // The `pending_list_` holds the current list of wake events waiting to be
  // reported.  Members of the list should remain on the list provided that:
  //
  // 1) They have been signaled at some point in the past, at least once.
  // 2) They are either not-yet-acknowledged, or not-yet-reported, or both.
  //
  // The PendingListLock is a spinlock used to protect the integrity of the
  // `pending_list_`, however due to another requirement, it alone is not
  // sufficient.  Specifically, it is a requirement that generating a report can
  // never hold off interrupt processing for O(n) time.  This requirement would
  // be violated if we had to hold the PendingListLock for the duration of a
  // report-generation operation. To avoid violating this requirement, we drop
  // the PendingListLock each time through the loop while iterating through the
  // pending list during report generation.
  //
  // The need to drop the PendingListLock during iteration while generating a
  // report leads to two other potential bad behaviors which we need to protect
  // against:
  //
  // 1) During report generation, we are holding an iterator to an element in
  //    the list.  This iterator cannot become invalidated during the period
  //    where we don't hold the lock.
  // 2) We must never "double report" a wake source in a single report.  IOW -
  //    if KOID X shows up once in the report generated for the user, it must
  //    not show up any more times _in that specific report_.
  //
  // There are a total of 4 operations which can affect report generation.  They
  // are:
  //
  // 1) Triggering.  This will update the bookkeeping for a wake event, and add
  //    that event to the pending list if it was not already on the list.  This
  //    operation is the only operation which takes place at hard IRQ time, and
  //    takes O(1) time.
  // 2) Ack'ing.  This will update the bookkeeping for a wake event, but will
  //    never remove the event from the list, even if it is now both reported
  //    and acknowledged. This operation always takes place in the context of a
  //    syscall made by user mode and is O(1).
  // 3) Construction/Registration.  Construction of a new wake event does
  //    not directly affect the pending_list_, but it does affect the total
  //    count of wake sources in the system which is a number which is also
  //    included in the wake source report.  This is an O(1) operation.
  // 4) Destruction/De-registration.  Destruction of a wake event always
  //    unconditionally removes the event from the pending list, if it is on the
  //    list at the time of destruction.  This is an O(1)) operation.
  //
  // -- Avoiding iterator invalidation --
  //
  // Report generation holds the GlobalListLock (a mutex) for the duration of a
  // report generation operation.  Construction/Destruction (#3-4) operations
  // must also hold the GlobalListLock meaning that they cannot invalidate a
  // report operation's iterator as they cannot run concurrently with the report
  // generation.  Trigger operations (#1) only add items, and therefore cannot
  // invalidate an intrusive list iterator.
  //
  // Ack operations (#2) could theoretically cause trouble if they were to
  // remove an element from the list as soon as it became both acked and
  // reported.  While it would not result in UAF, it could cause the report to
  // stop iteration early if the next element to report was acked and
  // immediately removed from the list.  To avoid this, ack operations will
  // never remove an element from the list.  Instead, they merely mark the
  // element as ack'ed and depend on report generation to handle the removal for
  // them, avoiding the invalidation issue in the process.
  //
  // Adopting this approach of having the report generation operation remove the
  // ack'ed wake source, instead of using the GlobalListLock to synchronize,
  // does two things for us.
  //
  // 1) It means that user mode ack operations will never need to obtain the
  //    GlobalListLock, and potentially block behind an O(n) report generation
  //    operation.
  // 2) It means that it is possible for kernel code it ack kernel-owned
  //    interrupts which also happen to be wake sources at hard IRQ time.
  //
  // -- Avoiding double reports --
  //
  // Construction/Destruction (#3-4) operations have no potential to produce a
  // double report in the first place, but they also cannot run concurrently
  // with report generation, so they have no potential to produce a double
  // report.  Likewise, ack'ing (#3) cannot produce a double report as it will
  // never remove an element from the list, only update the bookkeeping.  Even
  // if it did actually remove elements from the list, it couldn't produce a
  // double report.
  //
  // This means that only triggering (op #2) has the potential to produce a
  // double report.  A sequence which would produce this behavior would go like
  // this.
  //
  // 1) While a report is being generated, event X is encountered.  X has
  //    already been acknowledged, and now has certainly been reported, so X is
  //    removed from the pending list as the iterator is advanced to the next
  //    event, Y. The reporting thread then it drops the lock and starts to copy
  //    information into the user's buffer.
  // 2) X is now triggered again.  The IRQ handler grabs the pending lock, marks
  //    X as triggered, and adds it back to the end of the list, then drops the
  //    lock again.
  // 3) The reporting thread locks the list again, and processes Y.  It will
  //    advance down the list until it encounters X again, eventually adding
  //    it to the report a second time.
  //
  // Avoiding this situation is easy if we follow one simple rule. When an event
  // becomes triggered, it should be added to the *front* of the list instead of
  // the back.  This ensures that once report generation has started and the
  // initial iterator has been computed, no newly triggered events can show up
  // in this report.  They will have to wait to ride the next report-train.
