// # Design Notes
//
// BTree<> is an implementation of a variant of a b*+tree that aims to balance high density and
// operational simplicity. Btrees are are an associative container that support all the typical
// key-centric operations. Unlike, for example, a hashtable, keys in a btree are ordered and can be
// navigated between in constant time. The BTree<> is explicitly *not* intrusive, and as consequence
// key insertion may perform allocations, and may therefore fail. As a reward the BTree<> has very
// good cache locality making it quite efficient in practice to perform searches on.
//
// Like a typical b+tree data is only stored in leaf nodes, and all leaf nodes are the same depth
// from the root. Unlike a common b-tree, intermediate nodes store a key per child node, instead of
// storing a key 'between' each child node. This is a current implementation simplification (see
// comments on the Node structure).
//
// Like a b*tree, nodes are re-balanced where possible on insertion and deletion to improve density.
// Due to simplifications in the rebalancing process, as well as optimizations for tail insertion
// and head deletion, strict occupancy minimums are not observed, and nodes are allowed to be
// underfull (i.e. have less than half occupancy) at times.
//
// Some additional implementation choices made in the BTree<> are:
//  * Leaf nodes are, as is common in b+tree variants, placed in their own linked list for efficient
//    sequential traversal.
//  * Root node is variable size, both when it is a leaf and intermediate node, allowing for
//    efficiently storing small numbers of items.
//  * The left most and right most leaf nodes are stored in the root_ node (unless the root_ node
//    is the leaf node). This minimizes the size of the BTree<> structure itself, whilst still
//    allowing efficient begin() and end() traversals.
//
// A fundamental constraint of this implementation is that Nodes *must* be power of 2 size and size
// aligned in memory as the low bits of their pointers are used for storing extra data. This
// constraint is not considered onerous as an efficient implementation already would want Nodes to
// be a cache line multiple in size and cache line aligned to minimize false sharing.
//
// TODO(https://fxbug.dev/494059275): Remove some of these constraints.
// Some non-fundamental constraints that are in place until a use case needs to remove them are:
//  * Keys and values are both exactly 64-bits in size.
//  * Keys are a plain uint64_t
//  * Values are either a managed pointer (unique_ptr / RefPtr), raw pointer or a plain uint64_t.
//  * Key searching within a node is always linear and never a binary search.
//  * Maximum tree depth is presently fixed at 8.
//
// # Implementation details
//
// The BTree container is optimized to be as small as possible, aiming to occupy only a single
// machine word which stores a pointer to the root node.
//
// ## Node Layout and Metadata Packing
//
// Nodes store a set of key-value pairs (Items) based on their size class. To conserve space the
// node's size class, its current item count and whether it is a leaf node or not is packed into the
// lower bits of the 'prev' and 'next' pointers. This packing is possible because nodes are required
// to be power-of-two sized and aligned.
//
// Notably absent are any parent pointers. While a node can directly find its children, a node can
// only find its parent by walking from the root.
//
// ## Pointer Semantics
//
// The 'prev' and 'next' pointers serve different roles based on the node's type:
//  * Leaf Nodes: These pointers form a doubly-linked list across all leaf nodes in the tree,
//    allowing for O(1) sequential traversal in both directions.
//  * Non-Leaf Root Node: The pointers are used to store direct links to the leftmost and
//    rightmost leaf nodes. This allows `begin()` and `end()` to be implemented in constant time
//    by bypassing the tree traversal.
//  * Intermediate Nodes: These pointers are currently not used for navigation.
//
// ## Variable-Sized Root
//
// To improve memory efficiency for small collections, the root node is variable-sized. It grows,
// doubling in size at every step, through reallocation as items are added until it reaches the
// maximum size. If the tree depth increases, the new root node is again initialized at the smallest
// size class (on depth growth the new root will always contain two items, the old root and its new
// sibling).
//
// All non-root nodes (both leaf and intermediate) are allocated at the maximum size, which can be
// controlled through the NodeSize template parameter. This simplifies balancing and merging logic
// as it can be assumed that any time this is happening any nodes involved will be of the same
// (maximum) size.
//
// ## Operational Optimizations
//
// The implementation includes several optimizations that prioritize performance and density over
// strict B-tree invariants:
//  * Tail Insertion and Head Erasure: When the tree detects strictly ascending insertions or
//    sequential deletions from the front, it skips standard node rebalancing. For tail insertions,
//    this allows nodes to be filled to 100% capacity without the overhead of shifting items,
//    maintaining high density for common sequential workloads.
//  * Hinted Insertion: Providing an iterator hint allows the tree to attempt insertion
//    directly into a non-full leaf node, potentially avoiding a full tree walk entirely.
//
// ## Depth Limitation
//
// For simplicity and to avoid dynamic memory usage for path tracking, the tree depth is capped at
// a fixed constant (currently 8). This depth is sufficient to hold a vast number of items given
// the branching factor of the nodes. A btree, in the kernel, that would exceed this branching
// factor is, at least for all foreseeable use cases, just using too much kernel memory.
//
// ## Augmented State
//
// The BTree supports being augmented with custom state that is maintained and folded hierarchically
// up the tree. This is done by providing an `Observer` template argument. The observer defines the
// type of the augmented state and the functions to compute it for a leaf node and to fold it
// between sibling nodes. Maintaining this state enables specialized efficient traversals, such as
// finding a node by a cumulative sum or skipping entire subtrees during a `walk` operation. When
// augmented, nodes reserve space for this state which reduces the maximum number of items they can
// store.
//
// ## Validation
//
// To aid debugging and development some optional validation strategies are supported as templates
// on the root BTree class. These are provided as templates to allow tests to always enable
// validation, and different btree instantiations to optionally use them depending on what they are
// doing. For example, a new usage of the BTree might want iterator validation turned out during
// development, but this does not require other BTree users to need to have it on. The two types of
// validation are.
//  * BTREE_CHECK: These are controlled by the Validator template and are either noops or expand to
//    an assertion. Intended for use when performing development on the btree itself, these perform
//    expensive validation and checks that are not suitable for regular assertions.
//  * IteratorValidation: When set to ::Tracked this causes the main BTree to maintain a
//    modification generation, and iterators to retain an additional pointer back to the btree and
//    the generation they were created with. All of this allows any usage of stale iterators, even
//    benign ones, to be caught with assertion failures.
