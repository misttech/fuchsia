      // reference on the Dispatcher, and the Dispatcher cannot reach zero
      // handles while it is still living.  The only way for a PMT to become
      // quarantined is for it to reach OnZeroHandles before becoming unpinned.

      //
      // Case 1: The two operations are racing and using the same handle value,
      //         `H`, which is the final handle to the object.

      // One of these operations wins the race and removes `H` from the handle
      // table, and the other operation fails to find `H` in the table.  If the
      // unpin wins, then it keeps the dispatcher above a zero-handle count
      // until after the unpin is completed, meaning that it cannot hit zero
      // handles and cannot become quarantined.  If the handle close wins, then
      // the pin operation will not find the handle in the handle table, and
      // ReleasePinnedMemory will never be called.  Meanwhile, the final handle
      // will close and the PMT will be quarantined.
      //
      // Case 2: The two operations are racing and using different handle values,
      //         `H_close` and `H_unpin`
      //
      // It really does not matter who wins the race in this case.  `H_unpin` is
      // going find and the HandleOwner alive until the unpin complete, ensuring
      // that the object cannot hit zero-handles (and therefore cannot become
      // quarantined) before the unpin is finished.  The outcome of the race
      // only determines who ends up calling on_zero_handles on the dispatcher,
