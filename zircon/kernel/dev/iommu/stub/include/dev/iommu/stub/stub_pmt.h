  // Notes about StubPmt lifecycles and the cyclical reference from a StubPmt to
  // its owning StubBti held here.
  //
  // StubPmts are always created as a child of a StubBti, and during
  // construction, they take a reference to their StubBti owner (held here).
  // This reference is deliberately const, and is only ever released when the
  // StubPmt instance destructs.
  //
  // During operation, there are up to two references in the system which keep
  // the StubPmt reference alive.  They are:
  //
  // 1) A reference held by the StubBti from either the StubBti's active or
  //    quarantined PMT list.
  // 2) A reference held by the PMT dispatcher.
  //
  // There are two ways that all of these reference can be dropped triggering
  // the destruction of a StubPmt instance, dropping the owner-StubBti reference
  // in the process.
  //
  // 1) A user formally unpins the PMT via the dispatcher interface.  While
  //    holding the dispatcher reference, ReleasePinnedMemory is called, and the
  //    PMT follows its owner link up into its owning BTI where PMT is removed
  //    from the owner's active list, dropping reference #1 in the process.
  //    Later on, the user drops the final handle to the PMT dispatcher.  Once
  //    again, while holding the dispatcher's reference to the StubPmt object,
  //    OnDispatcherZeroHandles is called, but the object has already been
  //    formally unpinned, so not much actually happens (just some
  //    DEBUG_ASSERTs).  The call unwinds, and the PMT dispatcher is destroyed.
  //    This drops the StubPmt reference (ref #2) triggering the destruction of
  //    the StubPmt, dropping the owner reference in the process.
  // 2) A user closes the final handle to the PMT dispatcher without formally
  //    unpinning it.  OnDispatcherZeroHandles is called, and the StubPmt
  //    reference held by the StubBti owner (ref #1) is moved from the active
  //    list to the quarantine list.  The PMT dispatcher now destructs, dropping
  //    ref #2 in the process.  At some point in time later on, the quarantine
  //    protocol is followed, and user-mode eventually calls ReleaseQuarantine
  //    on their BTI.  The reference from the BTI dispatcher to the StubBti
  //    instance is used to clear the StubBti's quarantine list, dropping ref #1
  //    in the process.  The StubPmt then destructs, dropping the StubBti owner
  //    reference in the process.
