  // ** Leaked PMTs **
  //
  // If user-mode closes all of the handles to a PMT without making a call to
  // `zx_pmt_unpin`, the PMT has been "leaked".  This is considered to be a
  // violation of the IOMMU/BTI contract as drivers, when they are finished with
  // pinned memory, are supposed to make absolutely certain that their hardware
  // is no longer attempting to access the pinned memory before formally
  // signaling to the kernel that they have stopped their HW access by calling
  // `zx_pmt_unpin`.
  //
  // For things like the Stub IOMMU implementation, this is a big problem.  They
  // don't know if the driver's HW might still be attempting to access the memory, and
  // have no ability to stop it (as a real HW IOMMU would).  So, they are forced
  // to put the memory into a quarantine pool (not returning it to the physical
  // page pool) until the driver is restarted, shots down its hardware, and calls
  // `zx_bti_release_quarantine` to indicate that it is finally safe to return
  // the memory to the physical page pool.
  //
  // Similarly, an ARM SMMU operating in passthru mode has limited tools to deal
  // with a situation like this.  It is able to grant or revoke access to/from a
  // specific BTI, but only in an all or nothing fashion.  The initiator can
  // either access any memory, or no memory.  In a situation like this, the
  // leaked PMT memory _can_ be returned to the pool, but *only* after all
  // ability to access RAM has been revoked from the initiator.
  //
  // In either of these cases, the driver level BTI has entered a "Fault" state.
  // Requests to pin new memory will be denied with "Bad State", and some (or
  // all) of the device's ability to access memory will have been revoked from
  // it depending on the ability of the underlying HW to enforce policy.
  //
  // ** HW Induced Faults **
  //
  // The other reason a BTI might enter into the fault state is because of a
  // transaction fault caused by an invalid access from an initiator.  The HW
  // might have attempted to touch a page of memory which was never pinned (bad
  // address), or it might have attempted to touch a page which was pinned, but
  // with an invalid type of access (eg, it tried to write to a read only page).
  //
  // Stub IOMMUs cannot detect this as they have no hardware enforcement, but
  // actual HW IOMMUs who have translation and enforcement capabilities have a
  // problem in a situation like this.  If they simply print a warning (or
  // ignore the error entirely) and re-enable their fault interrupt, they are
  // almost certainly going to end up in a situation where they are constantly
  // taking interrupts from the disallowed HW accesses.
  //
  // Something has gone very wrong with the HW managed by the user-mode driver,
  // and only user-mode can fix it.  Part of the driver's behavior will be to
  // put the BTI into a "Fault" state, revoking all of the initiator's access to
  // memory and refusing to pin new memory until the driver has taken control of
  // their hardware and released their quarantine.
