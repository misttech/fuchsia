  // The reclaimable queues are the more complicated as, unlike the other categories, pages can be
  // in one of the queues, and can move around. The reclaimable queues themselves store pages that
  // are roughly grouped by their last access time. The relationship is not precise as pages are not
  // moved between queues unless it becomes strictly necessary. This is in contrast to the queue
  // counts that are always up to date.
  //
  // What this means is that the vm_page::page_queue index is always up to do date, and the
  // page_queue_counts_ represent an accurate count of pages with that vm_page::page_queue index,
  // but counting the pages actually in the linked list may not yield the correct number.
  //
  // New reclaimable pages are always placed into the queue associated with the MRU generation. If
  // they get accessed the vm_page_t::page_queue gets updated along with the counts. At some point
  // the LRU queue will get processed (see |ProcessIsolateAndLruQueues|) and this will cause pages
  // to get relocated to their correct list.
  //
  // Consider the following example:
  //
  //  LRU  MRU            LRU  MRU            LRU   MRU            LRU   MRU        MRU  LRU

  //    |  |    Insert A    |  |    Age         |     |  Touch A     |     |  Age       |  |
  //    V  v    Queue=2     v  v    Queue=2     v     v  Queue=3     v     v  Queue=3   v  v
  // [][ ][ ][] -------> [][ ][a][] -------> [][ ][a][ ] -------> [][ ][a][ ] -------> [ ][ ][a][]
  //
  // At this point page A, in its vm_page_t, has its queue marked as 3, and the page_queue_counts
  // are {0,0,1,0}, but the page itself remains in the linked list for queue 2. If the LRU queue is
  // then processed to increment it we would do.
  //
  //  MRU  LRU             MRU  LRU            MRU    LRU
  //    |  |                 |    |              |      |
  //    |  |       Move LRU  |    |    Move LRU  |      |
  //    V  v       Queue=3   v    v    Queue=3   v      v
  //   [ ][ ][a][] -------> [ ][][a][] -------> [][ ][][a]
