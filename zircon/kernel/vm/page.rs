/// Core per-page bookkeeping structure allocated at PMM arena creation time.
///
/// # Page Ownership vs. Rust Ownership
///
/// In the Zircon VM subsystem, there is a fundamental distinction between
/// **conceptual ownership of the page** (the physical memory allocation and its
/// lifecycle) and **Rust ownership of the `VmPage` data structure**:
///
/// - **Conceptual Page Ownership**: Subsystems such as `PmmNode`, `VmCowPages`,
///   or page queues obtain conceptual ownership over a page when allocating,
///   managing, or transferring it. This conceptual ownership governs the page's
///   physical memory allocation and lifecycle (e.g. committing, pinning, loaning,
///   or freeing the physical frame). Conceptual ownership also confers ownership
///   over *specific subfields* of the `VmPage` at specific phases of the page's
///   lifecycle. For example:
///   - When a page is held in a `VmCowPages`, that VM container possesses
///     ownership of the active union subfields (`object`, `page_offset`) in
///     `state_union`, subject to synchronization rules (e.g. modifications
///     occurring under the page queue lock).
///   - When a page is in a page queue or a PMM free list, the queue or list
///     owns the `queue_node` subfield for intrusive list linkage.
///   - Transitioning the page lifecycle state (`set_state`) requires conceptual
///     ownership of the page or holding the relevant subsystem lock.
///
/// - **Rust Ownership of the `VmPage` Data Structure**: All `VmPage` instances
///   are statically allocated at boot time as contiguous arrays of bookkeeping
///   memory inside PMM arenas. They remain permanently resident in memory and
///   are referenced by physical addresses, arenas, page queues, and raw pointers
///   across both C++ and Rust. Consequently, having conceptual ownership of a
///   page and the physical allocation it represents does **not** grant full,
///   exclusive Rust ownership (`VmPage` value ownership or `&mut VmPage`) over
///   the `VmPage` data structure. Multiple subsystems or threads may concurrently
///   hold shared references (`&VmPage`) or perform atomic queries on fields such
///   as `state_priv` and `loaned_state_priv`.
///
/// Because exclusive Rust ownership over `VmPage` can almost never be soundly
/// obtained, `&mut VmPage` or mutable borrows are fundamentally inappropriate.
/// Instead:
/// - Subfields that are mutated under subfield-level ownership or lock protection
///   (`queue_node` and `state_union`) are wrapped in [`UnsafeCell`].
/// - Fields subject to concurrent or lock-free inspection use atomics ([`AtomicU8`]).
/// - Fields that are immutable after arena initialization remain regular values
///   ([`usize`] for `paddr_priv`).
/// - All methods on `VmPage` take a shared reference (`&self`), requiring callers
///   to satisfy safety preconditions (holding conceptual ownership of the relevant
///   subfield or the appropriate subsystem locks) to access or mutate interior
///   state.
