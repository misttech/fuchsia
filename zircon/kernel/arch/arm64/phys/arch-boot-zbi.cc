  // coherence around that range should be managed by the kernel itself).
  //
  // While we could more simply issue `ic iallu` to invalidate the whole
  // instruction cache in a single instruction, we choose not to. This is a
  // reference implementation of the ZBI protocol and we want platform
  // exercise of out ZBI kernel code in the context of a minimally compliant
  // bootloader.

  // Before turning off the caches with the SCTLR_ELx change, make sure the
  // code right at the PC here is fully cleaned to main memory.  If this code
  // is running in the context of a ZBI or Linux kernel (e.g., a boot shim),
  // then this isn't strictly necessary as we have protocol guarantees that we
  // were loaded with this instruction memory clean (and we weren't likely to
  // have modified ourselves).  But better to be maximally defensive when it
  // comes to cache coherency.  arch::CleanDataCacheRange() has to be called in
  // the same assembly block since the compiler can always decide to duplicate
  // the code and it must materialize the local PC range for cache cleaning.
  //
  // Before handing off, clear the stack and frame pointers and the link
  // register so no misleading breadcrumbs are left.
