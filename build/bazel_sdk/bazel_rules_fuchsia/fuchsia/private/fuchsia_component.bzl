            This attribute can be a `fuchsia_component_manifest` target or a `.cml`
            file. If a `.cml` file is provided it will be compiled into a `.cm` file.
            If `component_name` is provided, the generated `.cm` file will
            inherit that name. Otherwise, it will keep the same basename.
            TODO(http://b/525461025): Implement the `component_name` behavior for the `.cm` file.

            If you need to have more control over the compilation of the `.cm` file
            we suggest you create a `fuchsia_component_manifest` target and pass
            it to this rule.
