    This function ensures that the parent remains alive to relay signals

    the entire process tree is signaled correctly.

    It handles SIGINT, SIGHUP, SIGTERM, and SIGQUIT.

    The forwarding policy is determined automatically:
    - If the process is a group leader (pgid == pid), signals are sent to the
      entire group (os.killpg).
    - Otherwise, signals are sent to the process PID only (os.kill).
