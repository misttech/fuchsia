  Run Fuchsia tests on infrastructure builders using locally built artifacts "Infra At Desk".
  Use this skill when you need to reproduce test failures that only occur in infra,
  or when you need to test on specific hardware (e.g., VIM3, NUC) that is not available locally.
compatibility: Test availability of this tool by running `fx test-remote --help`.

# `fx test-remote`

Reference: [fx test-remote documentation](http://go/fx-test-remote-docs)

## Capabilities

This skill allows you to:

1.  **List available infra builders** to find the right environment.
2.  **Run specific tests** on those builders using your local code changes.
3.  **Validate fixes** for infra-only failures without waiting for full CQ runs.

## Prerequisites

- You must test availability of this tool by running `fx test-remote --help`. If it succeeds, you can use it.

## Workflow

### 1. Find a Builder

Before running tests, identify the builder that matches the target environment. You should determine this from the user's prompt, Buganizer issue details, or provided CQ failure logs.

If it is not explicitly clear, run `fx status` to determine the local Board and Product configuration (e.g., `core` and `x64`) and use those to pick the closest matching builder from the list. Do NOT guess randomly.

```bash
fx test-remote --list-builders
```

_Tip: Filter the output to find specific architecture/product combos, e.g., `grep arm64`._

### 2. Run Tests

Execute the tests on the remote builder.

**Basic Syntax:**

```bash
fx test-remote --builder <BUILDER_NAME> --test <TEST_NAME>
```

**Common Flags:**

- `--builder`: (Required) Name of the infra builder (e.g., `bringup.arm64-debug`).
- `--test`: (Optional) Specific test target to run. Can be repeated. If omitted, runs _all_ tests in the builder's set (use with caution!).
- `--device`: (Optional) Filter by device type (e.g., `vim3`, `nuc11`, `emu`). Must be a case-insensitive substring of a device type in `//build/testing/platforms.gni` (`emu64` will not match, use `emu` for QEMU/AEMU).
- `--build-dir`: (Optional) Specify build directory (default: `out/test_remote`).
- `--skip-set`: (Optional) Skip `fx set` if you have already configured the remote build dir.

### 3. Example Scenarios

**Scenario A: Reproducing an infra failure**
You have a failure in `my-component-test` on the `core.x64-debug` builder.

```bash
fx test-remote --builder core.x64-debug --test my-component-test
```

**Scenario B: Testing driver changes on VIM3 hardware**
You modified a driver and want to test it on real hardware, but you don't have a VIM3 connected to the local workstation.

```bash
fx test-remote --builder core.vim3-debug --device vim3 --test my-driver-test
```

## Important Notes

- **Build Directory**: By default, this tool creates/uses `out/test_remote`. It **will** run `fx set` and `fx build` in that directory.
- **Capacity**: These tests run on the same pool as CQ. Limit execution to serial runs (do not run this tool in parallel) to avoid swamping the queue.
- **Logs**: `fx test-remote` **DOES NOT** stream test output. It only outputs the command it ran and the Buildbucket link, then exits. You must extract the Buildbucket URL/build ID from standard output and retrieve the test logs/results using infra tools (e.g. `bb get <build_id>`, Buildbucket UI, or CQ dashboards).
