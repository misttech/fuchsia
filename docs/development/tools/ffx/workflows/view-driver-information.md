# View driver information

The `ffx driver` command can retrieve various types of information about drivers
on a Fuchsia device.

## Concepts {:#concepts}

The `ffx driver` command can retrieve information related to drivers that are
currently [available](#view-drivers) or [running](#view-running-drivers) on
your target [Fuchsia device][flash-a-device] (or [emulator][fuchsia-emulator]).
However, the `ffx driver` command expects that you can establish an
[SSH connection][ssh-connection] to the target Fuchsia device from your host
machine. To verify this connection to the device, you can run the
[`ffx target show`][ffx-target-show] command.

Before using the `ffx driver` command, it is recommended that you familiarize
yourself with the fundamental concepts in [Driver framework (DFv2)][dfv2],
particularly the following:

- [Device nodes][device-nodes] - A device node represents a hardware component,
  a virtual device, or a part of a hardware device.
- [Node topology][node-topology] - A node topology describes the parent-child
  relationships between device nodes in the system.
- [Driver host][driver-host] - A driver host, which runs as a Fuchsia component,
  provides isolation between drivers in a Fuchsia system. In Fuchsia, every
  driver lives in a driver host, and more than one driver can be co-located
  within a single driver host.

## View drivers {:#view-drivers}

To view all drivers available on your Fuchsia device, run the following command:

```posix-terminal
ffx driver list
```

This command prints output similar to the following:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
$ ffx driver list
fuchsia-boot:///alc5663#meta/alc5663.cm
fuchsia-boot:///asix-88179#meta/asix-88179.cm

fuchsia-boot:///e1000#meta/e1000.cm
fuchsia-boot:///ftdi#meta/ftdi.cm
fuchsia-boot:///fvm#meta/fvm.cm
...
```

To view all drivers available on your Fuchsia device with more detailed
information, run the command with the -`v` flag:

```posix-terminal
ffx driver list -v
```

This command prints output similar to the following:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}

run the following command:

```posix-terminal
ffx driver dump
```

This command prints output similar to the following:

### View the node topology under a specific node {:#view-the-node-topology-under-a-specific-node}

To view only a subgraph of the node topology under a specific node,
run the following command:

```posix-terminal
ffx driver dump <NODE_NAME>
```

Replace `NODE_NAME` with the name of your target node, for example:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
$ ffx driver dump goldfish-control
[goldfish-control] pid=5521 fuchsia-boot:///goldfish_display#meta/goldfish-display.cm
  [goldfish-display] pid=5521 fuchsia-boot:///display-coordinator#meta/display-coordinator.cm
    [display-coordinator] pid=None unbound
...
```

### Graph the node topology {:#graph-the-node-topology}

To graph the node topology, run the following command:

```posix-terminal
ffx driver node graph
```

This command prints output similar to the following:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
$ ffx driver node graph
digraph {
    forcelabels = true; splines="ortho"; ranksep = 5; nodesep = 1;
    node [ shape = "box" color = " #0a7965" penwidth = 2.25 fontname = "prompt medium" fontsize = 10 margin = 0.22 ];
    edge [ color = " #283238" penwidth = 1 style = solid fontname = "roboto mono" fontsize = 10 ];
    rankdir = "TB"
    subgraph "cluster_19434" {
        label = "Host 19434";
        style = "filled,rounded";
        fillcolor = " #b1b9be";
        subgraph "cluster_19434_virtual-audio-driver.cm" {
            label = "virtual-audio-driver.cm";
            style = "filled,rounded";
            fillcolor = " #dce0e3";
            "4358549555312" [label="virtual-audio", id = "4358549555312"]
            "4358549791216" [label="virtual-audio", id = "4358549791216"]
        }
    }
...
```

#### Filtering {:#graph-the-node-topology-filtering}

A full Fuchsia system graph can be quite large. Use the `--only` (or `-o`)
flag to filter the graph to specific sections. You can also use this flag
to filter for only bound or unbound nodes.
For example, the following command only graphs the relatives
of the 'virtio-input' node:

```posix-terminal
ffx driver node graph -o relatives:PCI0.bus.00_03_0.00_03_0.virtio-input
```

Use the following filters with the `--only` flag
(the plural form, i.e., `ancestors`, is also accepted and has the same effect):

-   `--only bound`
    Shows only bound nodes. A node is bound if it meets any of the following conditions:
    -   A driver binds to it directly.
    -   It is a parent to a composite node.
    -   Its parent node explicitly owns it.
-   `--only unbound`
    Shows only unbound nodes (nodes that meet none of the bound conditions).
-   `--only ancestor(s):dev.sys.xyz`
    Shows only the ancestors of the specified node.
-   `--only descendant(s):dev.sys.xyz`
    Shows only the descendants of the specified node.
-   `--only relative(s):dev.sys.xyz`
    Shows only the relatives of the specified node. Relatives are both ancestors and descendants.
-   `--only sibling(s):dev.sys.xyz`
    Shows only the siblings of the specified node.
-   `--only primary_ancestor(s):dev.sys.xyz`
    Same as ancestor, but for composite nodes, it only traverses the primary parent.
-   `--only primary_relative(s):dev.sys.xyz`
    Same as relative, but for composite nodes, it only traverses the primary parent.
-   `--only primary_sibling(s):dev.sys.xyz`
    Same as sibling, but if the filter target is a composite node, this filter only
    includes children from its primary parent.

#### Showing service routes {:#graph-the-node-topology-services}

You can add service routes to the graph with the `--services` flag. The graph
displays these routes with an arrowhead to distinguish them from
parent/child relationships.

Adding service routes can create a very large graph that can overwhelm the graphic engine.
To avoid this, always use this flag with a filter. For example:


```posix-terminal
ffx driver node graph --services -o relatives:PCI0.bus.00_03_0.00_03_0.virtio-input
```

#### Creating the graph image {:#graph-the-node-topology-creating}

To convert this output to a `png` file, you can install the
[`dot`][dot]{:.external} command and pass the output to generate
the `png` file. Alternatively, you can paste the output to
[GraphViz][graphviz]{:.external}.

#### Generating an interactive graph {:#graph-the-node-topology-interactive}

You can generate an interactive HTML page from the SVG output to more easily
explore the graph. This HTML page lets you hover over and highlight service or parent/child routes.

To create the HTML file with a single command, pipe the graph output through `dot`
and then pipe the resulting SVG back into the graph command with the `--html` flag.

For example:

```posix-terminal
ffx driver node graph --services -o relatives:PCI0.bus.00_03_0.00_03_0.virtio-input | \
    dot -Tsvg | \
    ffx driver node graph --html > local/graph.html
```

If you use `GraphViz`, you can provide an existing SVG file with the `--svg` flag
instead of piping the output from `dot`.

## View device nodes {:#view-device-nodes}

To view the properties of all [device nodes][device-nodes] on your
Fuchsia device, run the following command:

```posix-terminal
ffx driver node list
```

This command prints output similar to the following:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}

```

To view the state and owner information of device nodes, run the command with the -`v` flag:

```posix-terminal
ffx driver node list -v
```

This command prints output similar to the following:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
$ ffx driver node list -v

### Filter for specific device nodes {:#view-device-nodes-filtering}

You can filter the list of nodes using the same filters described in the
[filtering](#graph-the-node-topology-filtering) section.

For example, this example only lists the descendants of the specified node:

```posix-terminal
ffx driver node list -o descendants:<NODE>
```

Replace `<NODE>` with a component moniker.

This example filters the results to only show the descendants of the `acpi` node:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
$ ffx driver node list -o descendants:acpi
acpi
acpi.acpi-_SB_
acpi.acpi-_TZ_
acpi.acpi-_SB_.pt

### Register a component as a driver {:#register-a-component-as-a-driver}

To register a component as a driver to your Fuchsia device,
run the following command:

```posix-terminal
ffx driver register <URL>
```

Replace `URL` with a component URL from your Fuchsia package
server, for example:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
$ ffx driver register fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/my_example#meta/my_new_driver.cm
```

### Disable a driver {:#disable-a-driver}

To disable (that is, de-register) a driver from your Fuchsia device,
run the following command:

```posix-terminal
ffx driver disable <URL>
```

Replace `URL` with a component URL from your Fuchsia package
server, for example:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
$ ffx driver disable fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/my_example#meta/my_driver.cm
```
