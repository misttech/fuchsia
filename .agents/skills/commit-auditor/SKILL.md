# Commit message auditor and diff matcher

Follow this 5-step workflow to prepare, audit, and commit changes.

## Step 1: Code Formatting & Diff Hygiene

1.  **Format Code**: Run from the repository root (or pass explicit files)
    before staging:
   ```bash
   fx format-code
   # Or: fx format-code --files=path/to/file1.cc,path/to/file2.rs
   ```
2.  **Explicit Staging**: Stage only the intended files explicitly by path:
   ```bash
   git add path/to/file1.cc path/to/file2.rs
   ```
   - **NEVER** use catch-all staging (`git add .`, `git add -A`, `git commit
     -a`).
   - In multi-repo workspaces, execute git commands in the target repository
     root (e.g., `//` or `//vendor/google`).
3.  **Diff Hygiene**: Inspect `git diff --staged` and ensure only intended
    changes are included:
   - **Accidentally Staged Files**: If scratch scripts, temporary files (`.tmp`,
     `.log`), or unrelated files were staged, unstage them:
     ```bash
     git restore --staged path/to/unwanted_file
     ```
   - **No Debug Code**: Strip debug prints (e.g., `printf("DEBUG_PRINT_TRAP")`)
     and temporary logging from staged code.
   - **No Gratuitous Churn**: Avoid unrelated comment/docstring rewording or
     purely stylistic variable renames.

## Step 2: Draft Commit Message to Scratch File

Important: Always draft and edit commit messages in a scratch file in your
designated scratch directory using native file tools (e.g., `write_to_file`).
NEVER use shell commands (`echo`, `cat << 'EOF'`, heredocs, redirection) or CLI
flags (`-m`, `--text`).

### Commit Message Structure & Example

```none
[component] Imperative summary line under 50 chars

Explain why this change is needed and what architectural problem it solves.
Wrap all body lines at 72 characters. Describe the net change relative to
the parent commit; use "add" or "create" for newly introduced files.

Bug: 123456
Test: fx test commit_msg_checker_test
```

### Formatting & Content Rules

- **Summary Line (Line 1)**:
  - Format: `[component] Imperative summary`, `subsystem: Imperative summary`,
    or `Imperative summary`.
  - Style: Capitalize first word after prefix; use imperative mood ("Add", not
    "Added"/"Adds").
  - Length: <= 50 chars recommended; hard limit <= 65 chars (revert/reland
    exempt).
  - Constraints: No trailing period. No issue tracker tags (`Bug:`) on line 1.
- **Blank Line (Line 2)**: Mandatory.
- **Body**:
  - Hard line-wrap at **72 characters** (exempt: URLs, bug IDs on `Bug:` lines,
    indented code, quote blocks).
  - **Engineering Rationale**: Explain *why* (architectural context), not just
    *what* (the diff shows *what*).
  - **Tone & Style**: Direct, professional engineering prose. Avoid robotic
    buzzwords, nominalization bloat, or parallelism breaks. No transient
    procedural commentary (e.g. "Ran tool X", "All files staged").
  - **Net Atomic Change**: Narrate net state relative to parent (`<commit>^`).
    Describe newly introduced files (`status A`) as `add`/`create`/`introduce`,
    never "update".
  - **Series**: For multi-part migrations, indicate series step in summary or
    body: `(1/3)`.
  - Never include "DO NOT SUBMIT".
- **Footers (Bottom, separated by blank line)**:
  - `Test: <actual_verification>` (**Required**): State how the change was
    verified. Must describe automated tests, manual testing, or ad-hoc
    verification genuinely performed (e.g., `Test: fx test foo_tests`, `Test:
    Manual verification on emulator`, `Test: Added unit tests`, or `Test: None,
    doc update`). Diagnostics (e.g., `--list`, `--help`, `git status`) and code
    formatting are **not** tests. Never fabricate tests or use `TODO`/`TBD`.
    Wrap at 72 chars; use multiple `Test:` lines for multiple suites.
  - `Bug: <id>` / `Fixed: <id>` (**Recommended**): One per line (`Bug: None` if
    standalone). `Fixed:` auto-closes the issue upon submission.
  - `Multiply: <test_name>` (Optional): Trigger deflake runs in infra for
    new/modified tests.
  - `Change-Id:` (**Gerrit Hook**):
    - **New commit**: Omit; generated automatically by Gerrit commit hook upon
      `git commit`.
    - **Amending existing commit**: Preserve exact `Change-Id: I...` (must be
      the final line).
  - Presubmit Controls (Optional): `Depends-on: <Change-Id>`, `Run-All-Tests:
    true`, `Cq-Include-Trybots: <builder>`.

## Step 3: Semantic Intent-to-Diff Audit

Inspect state efficiently in a single tool call:
- **For uncommitted / staged changes**: Run `git diff --staged --stat -p` to
  inspect the touched files summary and code diff at once.
- **For an existing commit on HEAD**: Run `git show --stat HEAD` to inspect the
  commit message, metadata footers, touched file summary, and code diff at once.

Cross-check the diff against your draft scratch file:

1.  **Diff → Narrative (Completeness & Scope)**:
   - Does the message account for all functional changes in the staged diff?
   - Are touched files described with verbs matching git status (`add`/`create`
     for `A`, `update`/`modify` for `M`)?
   - Is the patch cleanly scoped to a single logical change without unrelated
     refactors?
2.  **Narrative → Diff (Factual Support & Veracity)**:
   - Is every factual claim, bug fix, and architectural explanation backed by
     the staged code?
   - No ghost claims (unhandled edge cases or unadded features mentioned in
     text).
   - Component names match touched files in `git diff --stat` (no
     overgeneralized subsystem claims).
   - Every `Test:` line describes actual automated, manual, or ad-hoc
     verification performed in this session. Diagnostic queries (like `--list`
     or `status`) and formatting tools are not tests.

## Step 4: Mechanical Lint Check (Pre-Commit)

Warning: `fx lint` is a line-length checker only, NOT a semantic reviewer.
Passing `fx lint` (`exit code 0`) only proves lines are wrapped and tags are not
duplicated. It CANNOT verify whether your claims match the diff, whether tests
actually ran, or whether debug noise was staged. You MUST complete the Semantic
Intent Audit in Step 3 before running `git commit`.

Validate your draft scratch file before committing:

```bash
# Validate draft scratch file (note '--files=""', '--strict', and '--'):
fx lint --commit-msg --files="" -- --strict --message-file <scratch_file>
```

Note: For a read-only audit of a pre-existing commit on HEAD without amending,
run `fx lint --commit-msg -- --strict`.

`fx lint --commit-msg` validates:
- First line summary length (<= 65 characters)
- Body line wrapping (<= 72 characters)
- No duplicate `Change-Id` footers
- No duplicate `TAG` or `CONV` metadata tags

If the linter reports warnings or errors, edit your draft scratch file and
re-run Step 4 until clean.

## Step 5: Execute Commit or Amend

### Initial Commit
```bash
git commit -F <scratch_file>
```

### Amending Existing Commit / Rebase
1.  **Inspect & Preserve Metadata**: Run `git show --stat HEAD` to inspect the
    existing commit message and diff. Retain existing `Change-Id: I...` (must
    remain the final line) and existing `Bug:` tags in `<scratch_file>`.
2.  **Lint Draft**: `fx lint --commit-msg --files="" -- --strict --message-file
    <scratch_file>`
3.  **Stage & Amend**:
   ```bash
   git add <explicit_modified_files>
   git commit --amend -F <scratch_file>
   ```
   (If currently in an interactive rebase: `GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase
   --continue`)
4.  **Completion**: Once `git commit` or `git commit --amend` succeeds, the task
    is finished. Do not re-run `fx lint`, `fx format-code`, or redundant log
    queries post-commit.
