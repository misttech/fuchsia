//! Starnix-specific UTC clock implementation.
//!
//! UTC clock behaves differently in Fuchsia to what Starnix programs expect. This module abstracts
//! the differences away. It provides a UTC clock that always runs. In contrast to Fuchsia UTC
//! clock, which gets started only when the system is reasonably confident that the clock reading
//! is accurate.
//!
//! The paths in this module are somewhat hot, so we document typical measured performance in order
//! to remain performance-aware in this code. Assume that all the performance notes are made using
//! the same baseline device. If you need to add or change performance notes, verify first how far
//! removed your device is from the baseline.
//!
//! Starnix UTC clock is started from [backstop][ff] on initialization, and jumps to actual UTC once
//! Fuchsia provides actual UTC value.
//!
//! Consult the [Fuchsia UTC clock specification][ff] for details about UTC clock behavior
//! specifically on Fuchsia.
