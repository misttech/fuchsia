/// A builder for configuring new tasks to spawn.
///
/// The builder allows us to set up several different flavors of possible
/// tasks to spawn, with a menu of options as follows:
///
/// - A task may or may not have a name.
/// - A task may or may not have an assigned scheduler role.
/// - A task may be a sync, or an async closure.
/// - A task may return a result, or may not return a result.
/// - The task's result can be collected synchronously, asynchronously, or not collected at all.
///
/// Note that these parameters are not perfectly orthogonal. For example, a task spawned from an
/// async closure can not return a value asynchronously. (This is not a limitation of the approach,
/// rather it's the API that we explicitly use today.) Also, some parameter combinations do not
/// make sense, for example a spawn request can not have both a sync and an async closure to run.
///
/// The builder API is designed in a way that only allows chaining the configuration options which
/// are valid at that point in the configuration process. Invalid option combinations are
/// compile-time(!) errors. It will only allow creating a [SpawnRequest] if enough parameters have
/// been passed such that there is enough information to create a request. It will not allow
/// passing conflicting parameters: for example, if you already passed one synchronous closure, it
/// is impossible to pass another closure and have the code compile without errors.
///
