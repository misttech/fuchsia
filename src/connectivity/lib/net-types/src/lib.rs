//! Networking types and operations.
//!
//! This crate defines types and operations useful for operating with various
//! network protocols. Some general utilities are defined in the crate root,
//! while protocol-specific operations are defined in their own modules.
//!
//! # Witness types
//!
//! This crate makes heavy use of the "witness type" pattern. A witness type is
//! one whose existence "bears witness" to a particular property. For example,
//! the [`UnicastAddr`] type wraps an existing address and guarantees that it
//! is unicast.
//!
//! There are a few components to a witness type.
//!
//! First, each property is encoded in a trait. For example, the
//! [`UnicastAddress`] trait is implemented by any address type which can be
//! unicast. The [`is_unicast`] method is used to determine whether a given
//! instance is unicast.
//!
//! Second, a witness type wraps an address. For example, `UnicastAddr<A>` can
//! be used with any `A: UnicastAddress`. There are two ways to obtain an
//! instance of a witness type. Some constants are constructed as witness types
//! at compile time, and so provide a static guarantee of the witnessed property
//! (e.g., [`Ipv6::LOOPBACK_IPV6_ADDRESS`] is a `UnicastAddr`). Otherwise, an
//! instance can be constructed fallibly at runtime. For example,
//! [`UnicastAddr::new`] accepts an `A` and returns an `Option<UnicastAddr<A>>`,
//! returning `Some` if the address passes the `is_unicast` check, and `None`
//! otherwise.
//!
//! Finally, each witness type implements the [`Witness`] trait, which allows
//! code to be written which is generic over which witness type is used.
//!
//! Witness types enable a variety of operations which are only valid on certain
//! types of addresses. For example, a multicast MAC address can be derived from
//! a multicast IPv6 address, so the `MulticastAddr<Mac>` type implements
//! `From<MulticastAddr<Ipv6Addr>>`. Similarly, given an [`Ipv6Addr`], the
//! [`to_solicited_node_address`] method can be used to construct the address's
//! solicited-node address, which is a `MulticastAddr<Ipv6Addr>`. Combining
//! these, it's possible to take an `Ipv6Addr` and compute the solicited node
//! address's multicast MAC address without performing any runtime validation:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use net_types::ethernet::Mac;
//! # use net_types::ip::Ipv6Addr;
//! # use net_types::MulticastAddr;
//! fn to_solicited_node_multicast_mac(addr: &Ipv6Addr) -> MulticastAddr<Mac> {
//!     addr.to_solicited_node_address().into()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Naming Conventions
//!
//! When both types and traits exist which represent the same concept, the
//! traits will be given a full name - such as [`IpAddress`] or
//! [`UnicastAddress`] - while the types will be given an abbreviated name -
//! such as [`IpAddr`], [`Ipv4Addr`], [`Ipv6Addr`], or [`UnicastAddr`].
//!
//! [`is_unicast`]: crate::UnicastAddress::is_unicast
//! [`Ipv6::LOOPBACK_IPV6_ADDRESS`]: crate::ip::Ipv6::LOOPBACK_IPV6_ADDRESS
