//! At a high level, the primary element of this module is the `Calls` struct.
//! This is a container for a number of `Call` structs.
//!
//! Each `Call` is a `Stream` of `CallOutput` which are used to drive the
//! current running procedure, initiate a new procedure, or do other things like
//! tear down SCO.  Internally, the `Call` wraps a request stream for the `Call`
//! protocol which allows FIDL clients to control the call.
//!
//! For example, a headset or carkit may send a FIDL request to hang up an in
//! progress call, and this would eventually cause the corresponding `Call`
//! stream to yield the appropriate `CallOutput`,
//! `CallOutput::ProcedureInput(ProcedureInput::CommandFromHf(CommandFromHf::HangupCall))`.
//! Additionally `Call` has several methods on it that allow the
//! `ProcedureManager` to manipulate it, such as by setting the phone number
//! associated with the call.
//!
//! However, the `Call` struct is not public--instead it is accessed through the
//! `Calls` struct, which contains zero or more `Call` structs. The `Calls`
//! struct also is a `Stream`.  It multiplexes the `Stream`s of the internal
//! `Call` structs.  Similarly, the `Calls` struct has several public methods to
//! set `Call` state that are routed to the proper `Call`.
