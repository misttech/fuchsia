    This driver is used when executing Mobly tests in the infra environment.
    Due to Swarming's dimension-based test allocation system, the testbed used
    for running a test is not known until at test-run-time (after Swarming bot
    has been allocated).

    InfraDriver handles this by dynamically generating a Mobly test config file
    based on the Swarming bot's advertised devices. Besides config generation,
    InfraDriver also handles the infra-specific integration necessary for that
    Mobly test results to be plumbed to Fuchsia's result storage backend.
