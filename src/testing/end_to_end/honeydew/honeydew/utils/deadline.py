"""A more ergonomic Deadline type.

# Why not `datetime`?

The `datetime` module has a number of footguns that make it unsuitable for use
as a deadline type in tests:

1. It's easy to create a timezone-naive datetime, and creating timezone-aware
   datetimes is verbose.
2. `datetime` does not have a built-in way to represent an infinite deadline.
   `datetime.min` and `datetime.max` exist, but don't behave correctly with
   respect to arithmetic.
3. Infinite deadlines tend to be represented by `None`, which can be confused
   with a "default" deadline.
