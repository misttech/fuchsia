// TODO: `HandleDecoder` and `HandleEncoder` have terrible little methods:
// `take_raw_driver_handle` and `push_raw_driver_handle`. These exist because of
// two intersecting problems:
//
// 1. When writing `Encode` and `Decode` impls for a type, it can't just add
//    `where` clauses bounding `<field_ty>: Encode<___E>`. This is because some
//    FIDL type definitions are recursive, and Rust impls can't be coinductive.
//    So instead, we have to check whether the type is a `resource` and emit
//    `E: HandleEncoder` if it is.
//
// 2. The FIDL IR only tracks whether or not a type is a resource. It doesn't
//    track which resource types it contains. That means that if a type is a
//    resource, we don't know whether that's because it contains a handle, or
//    because it contains a driver handle.
//
// So the unfortunate result is that we have to combine all of the resource type
// encoding and decoding traits into a single one. If we fix this someday, then
// we can get rid of those methods and make separate `DriverHandleDecoder` and
// `DriverHandleEncoder` types.
