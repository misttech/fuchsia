/// A transport backend which can send and receive messages.
///
/// # Terminology
///
/// Note that this trait does not correspond directly with the FIDL notion of a
/// transport. For clarity, implementors of this trait should be called
/// "transport backends", as they are specific implementations of the more
/// general notion of a "transport" in FIDL.
///
/// In FIDL, protocols can be assigned a "transport" such as "Channel" or
/// "Driver". The choice of transport for a protocol controls the concrete types
/// used for client ends and server ends of that protocol. A protocol with
/// "Channel" transport will have client and server ends that are Zircon
/// channels; a protocol with "Driver" transport will have client and server
/// ends that are Driver channels.
///
/// All transport backends must be able to send and receive buffers of bytes. In
/// addition to those bytes, transport backends may also support sending and
/// receiving resource types like Zircon and Driver handles with those bytes.
/// The additional resource types a transport backend supports defines which
/// protocols can be run over that transport backend: a protocol can be run over
/// a transport backend if all of the resource types its messages may contain
/// can be sent and received using that transport backend. This may or may not
/// have a correlation with the FIDL transport of that protocol.
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// The futures provided by this trait should be cancel-safe, which constrains
/// their behavior:
///
/// - Operations should not partially complete.
/// - Operations should only complete during polling.
///
/// `SendFuture` should return `Poll::Ready` with an error when polled after the
/// transport backend is closed.
