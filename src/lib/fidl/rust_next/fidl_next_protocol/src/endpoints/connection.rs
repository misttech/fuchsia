///   several threads simultaneously. `Connection`s provide a mechanism for
///   gracefully closing transports by causing all sends to pend until the
///   connection is terminated, and all receives to fail instead of pend.
/// - FIDL connections may send and receive an epitaph as the final message
///   before the underlying transport is closed. This epitaph should be provided
///   to all sends when they fail, which requires additional coordination.
