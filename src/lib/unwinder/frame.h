  // facto standard to mark unwind information for signal trampolines. Unfortunately it's also not
  // mentioned in any of the Linux Standard Base (LSB) nor in any of the ARM vendor DWARF extension
  // specifications or other standards referenced by this unwinder. In practice, this is set by hand
  // writing CFI directives (.cfi_signal_frame in particular).
  //
  // The best references that can be found are in source code of other unwinders: libgcc has the
  // canonical implementation of this augmentation [1], and libunwind also implements it [2].
  //
  // .cfi_signal_frame is not always set on functions that are actually signal frames, so this flag
  // can be set by probing the instruction sequence set at |pc| for a particular sigreturn method,
  // which has a predictable and short instruction sequence. This approach is only taken in the case
  // the CFI unwinder failed to find the 'S' augmentation.
