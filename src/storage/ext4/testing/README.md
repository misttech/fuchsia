# Testing

`test_ext4_server` is a utility component that can be used for testing of the
Ext4 library.

Note that this test server exposes an ext4 filesystem with full read
functionality but limited write support which currently only includes
overwriting existing allocated files. If a write operation attempts to write
past EOF, the operation will fail with a "not supported" error. Truncate is also
supported but not that metadata is not persisted.


An ext4 image must be provided to the server. On startup, the server reads an
Ext4 filesystem image from its package data directory
(`/pkg/data/ext4_image.img`).

## Usage

To use this component in a test, use the `ext4_test_server` GN template provided
in `test_ext4_server.gni`.

```gn
import("//src/storage/ext4/testing/test_ext4_server.gni")

ext4_test_server("ext4_test_pkg") {
  image = "path/to/my_image.img"
}
```

This template will:
1.  Include the `my_image.img` as a resource in the package, mapped to
    `data/ext4_image.img`.
2.  Create a `fuchsia_package` containing the server and the image.

### Component Manifest Integration

To use the server in your test, include the provided manifest shard in your
test's component manifest. This shard automatically adds the server as a child
and mounts its `root` directory to `/test_ext4_filesystem_root`.

In `my_test.cml`:
```json5
{
    include: [
        "//src/storage/ext4/testing/meta/server.shard.cml",
    ],
    ...
}
```
