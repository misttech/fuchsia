//! Safe wrappers for raw pointer byte slices.
//!
//! This crate provides [`PtrByteSlice`] and [`MutPtrByteSlice`], which are designed for use in
//! scenarios involving cross-process shared memory (e.g., communication with driver processes or
//! other untrusted components).
//!
//! ### Rationale
//!
//! In a multi-process system like Fuchsia, processes often share memory via VMOs (Virtual Memory
//! Objects). If a process shares a memory region with another process, that other process (which
//! may be compromised or untrusted) can modify the memory concurrently at any time.
//!
//! In Rust, creating a standard reference (`&[u8]` or `&mut [u8]`) over memory that can be
//! modified concurrently by another party is **Undefined Behavior (UB)**. The Rust compiler
//! assumes that the data behind a shared reference (`&T`) is immutable and cannot change
//! unexpectedly, allowing it to perform optimizations that assume stability. If the memory changes
//! concurrently, these assumptions are violated.
//!
//! To avoid UB, we must avoid creating standard Rust references to concurrently-modifiable shared
//! memory. Instead, we must treat the shared memory as raw pointers.
//!
//! [`PtrByteSlice`] and [`MutPtrByteSlice`] wrap these raw pointers and provide a safe API to:
//! 1.  **Copy data out** of the shared region into private, allocator-managed memory (e.g., via
//!     `copy_to_slice` or `to_vec`). Once copied, the private data is safe from concurrent
//!     modification and can be safely represented as standard Rust slices.
//! 2.  **Perform structured access** (e.g., via `iter_as` or `iter_as_mut`) only when the underlying
//!     types guarantee that arbitrary byte patterns are valid (via `FromBytes`) and we accept that
//!     the values might change (though we must still be careful about Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use
//!     (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities).
//!
//! By removing direct access to the underlying slice (i.e., not providing `as_slice` or
//! `as_mut_slice` methods), this crate enforces that helper components must copy data into trusted
//! buffers before operating on it, ensuring both memory safety (no UB) and robustness against
//! concurrent modification.
//!
//! This crate does nothing to prevent data races; responsibility for handling data races lies
//! elsewhere.
