// Theory of operation of ShutdownManager:
//  There are a number of ways shutdown can be initiated:
//   - The process could be terminated, resulting in a signal from the Lifecycle channel
//   - Any of the fidl connections could be dropped
//  These events can cause one of two stages of the driver shutdown to be triggered:
//  Package Shutdown:  The shutdown manager signals the node_remover to shut down all package
//  drivers; ie: drivers that depend on storage and fshost.
//  Boot/All Shutdown:  The shutdown manager signals the node_remover to shut down all drivers.
//
//  When the node_remover signals it has completed removing the package drivers,
//  The Shutdown Manager will transition to kPackageStopped.  If something has signaled the
//  Shutdown Manager to shutdown the boot drivers in that time, the shutdown manager will
//  transition to shutting down boot drivers immediately after the package drivers are removed.
//  Otherwise, the Shutdown Manager will wait for an invocation of SignalBootShutdown before
//  shutting down boot drivers.
//  Either way, when boot drivers are fully shutdown, the Shutdown Manager will signal the
//  system to stop in some manner, dictated by what is returned by `GetSystemPowerState`.
//  The default state, which is invoked if there is some error, is REBOOT.
//  Any errors in the shutdown process are logged, but ulimately do not stop the shutdown.
//  The ShutdownManager is not thread safe. It assumes that all channels will be dispatched
//  on the same single threaded dispatcher, and that all callbacks will also be called on
//  that same thread.
