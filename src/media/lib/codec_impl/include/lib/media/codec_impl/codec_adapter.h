// up to one active stream to worry about, and Codec FIDL protocol enforcement
// has already been handled above.
//
// For HW-based codecs that need to share the HW, a CodecAdapter represents up
// to one active stream, and does not directly participate in sharing the HW;
// that's further down.
//
// The intent of this interface is to be as narrow an in-process codec interface
// as feasible between FIDL protocol aspects above, and codec-specific details
// below.
//
// For DFv2 drivers, avoid assuming that the thrd_t will be the same for
// separate calls in the same ordering domain, as DFv2 is allowed to switch

// This class is sub-classed to implement a specific codec. The sub-class can be

// codec SW lib or FW/HW has a similar interface for decode and encode, it can
// sometimes be reasonable to have a sub-class that's not specific to decode vs
// encode, then further decoder vs encoder sub-classes under that. For HW with
// very different/separate interfaces for decode vs. encode it's more typical to
// sub-class CodecAdapter separately for decode vs. encode. For drivers, some
// aspects common to decode and encode can be in the

  // allocation. The CodecAdapter should always set buffer count fields assuming
  // non-dynamic buffer allocation. For example, min_buffer_count_for_camping
  // should be set assuming non-dynamic buffer allocation. The caller
  // (CodecImpl) will fix up the buffer count fields to ensure that dynamic
  // buffer allocation isn't forced to allocate more buffers than the
  // StreamProcessor client is indicating.
  //
  // Input:
  //
  // For now, a core codec has no way to trigger being asked for new input
  // constraints, so the input constraints (for now) need to be generally
  // applicable to any potential setting/property of the input.
  //
  // A decoder should permit a fairly wide range of buffer space, without
  // worrying whether the min is enough to efficiently handle a high bitrate.
  // The CodecImpl will own bumping up the min based on approximate bitrate
  // provided in the initial decoder creation parameters and/or per-stream input
  // format details (this logic is shared because it can reasonably be shared).
  // A core codec that has special requirements for extra input buffer space
  // given a particular bitrate can take it upon itself to set the input min
  // buffer space, but the idea is that typically it won't be necessary for a
  // decoder to increase the min based on input bitrate beyond what CodecImpl
  // does, so needing to do this should be fairly rare.
  //
  // A video encoder which needs to vary it's input BufferCollectionConstraints
  // based on encoder settings can do so, using the data provided to
  // CoreCodecInit(). If later use of QueueInputFormatDetails() (per-stream)
  // results in an input packet that conforms to the old
  // BufferCollectionConstraints but does not conform to the effective new
  // BufferCollectionConstraints, the core codec can use
  // CodecAdapterEvents::onCoreCodecFailCodec() (the core codec should fail the
  // codec instance in this case rather than attempt to handle input data that
  // is outside the bounds that would have been indicated by the core codec had
  // the current input format details been used as the initial format details).
  // Clients that change the input format details on the fly should be willing
  // to re-request a new codec instance at least once starting with the new
  // input format details via the CodecFactory. This is true for additional
  // reasons beyond this paragraph involving the possibility of accelerated but
  // partial codec implementations. If a client needs to change input format
  // details but doesn't want to concern itself with tracking whether the
  // current codec was created with the current input format details, a client
  // can instead choose to always create a new codec via CodecFactory on any
  // change to the input format details.
  //
  // Output:
  //
  // A CodecAdapter can trigger this method to get called again by indicating an
  // output format detection/change with action_required true via
  // CoreCodecEvents::onCoreCodecMidStreamOutputConstraintsChange().
  //
  // Filling out the usage bits is optional. If the usage bits are not filled
  // out (all still 0), the caller will fill them out based on
  // IsCoreCodecMappedBufferUseful() and IsCoreCodecHwBased(). The core codec
  // must either leave usage set to all 0, or completely fill them out.
  //
  // The CodecAdapter must not set must_match_vmo (at least for now). The intent
  // of this rule is to avoid the CodecAdapter unnecessarily constraining new
  // buffers of a new buffer_lifetime_ordinal to have the same
  // SingleBufferSettings as buffers of a previous buffer_lifetime_ordinal.
  //
  // All buffers of a given buffer_lifetime_ordinal are are guaranteed to have
  // the same sysmem SingleBufferSettings. This is enforced by CodecImpl.
  //
  // For decoder output, if a stream is active, the CodecAdapter needs to make
  // sure that the constraints are set such that the stream can continue
  // decoding correctly given buffers that conform to the returned constraints.
  // This may imply tighter constraints than would be returned if a stream
  // weren't active. There is no requirement that a video decoder be able to
  // handle switching PixelFormatAndModifier mid-stream, but if a CodecAdapter
  // doesn't prevent that using the constraints here, that can happen, and then
  // the CodecAdapter is expected to correctly handle it without dropping any
  // output frames specified by the bitstream.
  //
  // If an uncompressed video port is listing more than one
  // PixelFormatAndModifier, and has at least one linear pixel_format_modifier,

  // RAM domain for sharing of buffers, whether protected buffers were
  // allocated, etc.
  //
  // When using dynamic buffers, the "buffers" field is un-set. In this case the
  // core codec must rely on CoreCodecAddBuffer calls to know how many current
  // buffers there are for a given port (until
  // CoreCodecEnsureBuffersNotConfigured which resets the count of current
  // buffers to 0 for a given port). In this context, "current buffers" does not

  //
  // This call occurs shortly before the first CoreCodecAddBuffer when starting

  //
  // If the codec supports dynamic buffers, the buffer_collection_info passed to
  // this call will have buffers.size() == 0, and the codec should treat that as
  // normal. Other fields are valid. The codec needs to configure a buffer
  // dynamically when CoreCodecAddBuffer is called, including after processing
  // has begun.
  //
  // A CodecAdapter that supports dynamic buffers and whose output constraints
  // ever change (inter-stream or intra-stream) must tolerate a call to
  // CoreCodecSetBufferCollectionInfo (re. output) with SingleBufferSettings
  // that are not suitable to continue processing the current position of the
  // current stream (whether the stream is actively processing or not). The
  // expected way for the CodecAdapter to handle this is to track its own output
  // constraints version uint64_t which changes atomically along with any
  // updates to the data from which sysmem constraints for output are derived
  // (such as when a decoding video stream changes dimensions). The CodecAdapter
  // should also track whether onCoreCodecMidStreamOutputConstraintsChange has
  // been called yet for the current output constraints version. When the output
  // constraints version changes, this called-yet bool gets reset to false. The
  // CodecAdapter should evaluate whether the current SingleBufferSettings are
  // suitable for continued processing (a) just after the output constraints
  // version has changed and (b) just after the SingleBufferSettings are
  // set/changed by a call to CoreCodecSetBufferCollectionInfo. If the
  // SingleBufferSettings are not suitable and the called-yet bool is false, the
  // CodecAdapter must call onCoreCodecMidStreamOutputConstraintsChange and set
  // the called-yet bool to true. Using this scheme, the CodecAdapter helps
  // achieve the following:
  //   * Processing doesn't pause if the current buffers are fine.
  //   * Unnecessary buffer reallocations are avoided.
  //   * Reallocation of buffers is reliably triggered when new buffers are
  //     needed.
  //   * The client can start the process of replacing buffers at any time as
  //     needed for client-specific reasons.
  //
  // The buffer_collection_info and its SingleBufferSettings are guaranteed to
  // conform to at least one BufferCollectionConstraints previously returned
  // from a previous call to CoreCodecGetBufferCollectionConstraints3/2. In

  //     this only comes up for vp9 show_existing_frame.
  //
  // All CodecPacket instances created under a given buffer_lifetime_ordinal
  // remain allocated until all buffers of the buffer_lifetime_ordinal have been
  // dropped by the CodecAdapter. This allows a CodecAdapter to access a
  // CodecPacket instance as long as the CodecAdapter still has any buffers
  // under the same buffer_lifetime_ordinal, regardless of whether the packet is
  // currently free with the CodecAdapter or in-flight with the client. While
  // this can result in quite a few more currently-allocated packets than
  // buffers under an old buffer_lifetime_ordinal, the packets aren't large, and
  // the number of old still-active buffer_lifetime_ordinal values is capped.
  //
  // If DetailedCodecDescription.supports_dynamic_buffers is true, this call can
  // happen for packets of an old buffer_lifetime_ordinal. If false, this call
  // will only happen for packets of the current buffer_lifetime_ordinal.
  //
  // If DetailedCodecDescription.supports_dynamic_buffers is true, the
  // CodecAdapter must tolerate this call when the CodecAdapter has already
  // closed all buffers of the packet's buffer_lifetime_ordinal. This can happen
  // if CodecImpl hasn't yet processed ZX_VMO_ZERO_CHILDREN corresponding to the
  // last closed handle to the last buffer of the old buffer_lifetime_ordinal.
  // For CodecAdapter(s) that need to sometimes output a buffer with an old
  // buffer_lifetime_ordinal, one way to accomplish this is to keep the
  // CodecAdapter's context for the old buffer_lifetime_ordinal until
  // CoreCodecCloseBufferLifetimeOrdinal, even though all handles to the old
  // buffers have been closed. For CodecAdapter(s) that never output a buffer
  // with old buffer_lifetime_ordinal, the CodecAdapter can keep no context for
  // old buffer_lifetime_ordinal(s), and ignore this call if the packet isn't
  // for the current buffer_lifetime_ordinal.
  //
  // Despite this recycling mechanism, it's not permitted for a CodecAdapter to
  // change the contents of any buffer with an old buffer_lifetime_ordinal. Only
  // buffers of the current buffer_lifetime_ordinal can be written to. When a
  // StreamProcessor client has not sent StreamProcessor.EnableOldOutputBuffers,
  // CodecImpl will immediately recycle all the client-owned output packets with
  // old buffer_lifetime_ordinal as soon as the buffer_lifetime_ordinal is
  // out-of-date (shortly after CoreCodecEnsureBuffersNotConfigured or
  // CoreCodecRemoveBuffer has been called applying to all buffers of the
  // out-of-date buffer_lifetime_ordinal). However, the client will likely still
  // have some of the old buffers in its output queue or downstream being
  // rendered etc. This restriction is an additional reason that the
  // CodecAdapter must not select any buffer of an old buffer_lifetime_ordinal
  // as a free buffer to be filled with new output data, even if there are no
  // packets outstanding with that buffer from the CodecAdapter's point of view,
  // and the new output data would fit. The packets recycled here with old
  // buffer_lifetime_ordinal are only for the CodecAdapter to potentially use to
  // output another old output buffer in the output sequence that was filled
  // back when the buffer's buffer_lifetime_ordinal was current.

  // De-configure input or output buffers. This will never occur at a time when
  // the core codec is expected to be processing data. For input, this can only

  // input data is queued, or during processing shortly after the core codec
  // calling onCoreCodecMidStreamOutputConstraintsChange(true), after
  // CoreCodecMidStreamOutputBufferReConfigPrepare() and before
  // CoreCodecMidStreamOutputBufferReConfigFinish().
  //
  // The "ensure" part of the name is because this needs to ensure that buffers
  // will be fully de-configured (and handles dropped) as soon as the buffer is
  // no longer needed in the DPB or in an output queue. When not between
  // CoreCodecMidStreamOutputBufferReConfigPrepare and
  // CoreCodecMidStreamOutputBufferReConfigFinish calls, this means handles to
  // all buffers of the specified port should be dropped quickly and before
  // returning from this call, since there is no active stream or the stream
  // hasn't seen any input data yet, so (using video decoders as an example)
  // there are no output frames in the DPB and no reason to retain any buffers
  // relevant to any output queue (any such output is already known to be safe
  // to drop).
  //
  // The handles to VMOs that the CodecAdapter has are handles to child VMOs,
  // and CodecImpl needs all handles to a child VMO to be closed before
  // StreamProcessor.RemoveBuffer can complete. Keeping a handle open longer
  // than necessary is visible to StreamProcessor clients above, and in some
  // cases could cause the whole pipeline to stall.
  //
  // Any memory mappings to buffers must also be removed, as these keep the
  // child VMO from being dropped at zircon layer.
  //
  // As always, the codec must ensure that zero DMA writes to a buffer will
  // occur during any interval when the buffer is not pinned.
  //
  // This call needs to work regardless of whether buffers are presently fully
  // de-configured already, or if CoreCodecAddBuffer() has been called 1-N times
  // but CoreCodecConfigureBuffers() hasn't been called yet (and won't be, if
  // this method is called instead), or if CoreCodecAddBuffer() has been called
  // N times and CoreCodecConfigureBuffers() has also been called.
  //
  // The "not configured" means pending removal or removed, as appropriate. An
  // output buffer that's still used by bitstream-spec-specified decoder state
  // can still be emitted as output, but as soon as the buffer is no longer used
  // by bitstream-spec-specified decoder state, any handles to the buffer held
  // by the CodecAdapter must be closed. Closing any relevant handles during
  // this call isn't strictly required, but they should be closed asap without
  // damaging any ongoing decoder state.
  //
  // For CodecAdapter(s) with IsSupportsDynamicBuffers() true, this won't get
  // called, and instead CodecImpl will call CoreCodecRemoveBuffer on specific
  // buffers as appropriate.
  //
  // If there's a current stream that has seen input, and a buffer is still
  // needed to retain stream processing context, or to maintain validity of an
  // item in an output queue, the CodecAdapter should retain at least one
  // handle to the buffer (based on CodecBuffer.GetChildVmo) until the buffer is
  // no longer needed, at which point the handle to the buffer should be closed
  // quickly (this is should, not must). If the CodecAdapter does the preceding,

  // with an old packet and old buffer if output of an old buffer is specified
  // by the bitstream (this is should, not must, and only if the CodecAdapter is
