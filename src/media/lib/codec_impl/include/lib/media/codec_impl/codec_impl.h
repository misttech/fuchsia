// The CodecImpl class can be used for both SW and HW codecs.
//
// Roughly speaking, this class converts the Codec FIDL interface which has
// cross-process pipelining of stream switches into a more synchronous
// in-process CodecAdapter interface which only has input and output data
// handled async, with stream control handled sync for the most part.
//
// This class also handles Codec protocol checks applicable to any Codec server.
//
// TODO(dustingreen): Pull CodecImpl out to a source_set, to be used by
// omx_codec_runner.h/cc also.

// Lifetime:
//
// A CodecImpl is created, either Bind()ed or destructed, and if Bind()ed, then
// later when the channel fails or there's a protocol error, calls the owner's
// error handler and the owner deletes the CodecImpl.  There is intentionally no
// way to reuse a CodecImpl for another Codec channel.

// Error handling:
//
// There are two types of errors, per-CodecImpl errors and per-devhost-process
// errors.
//
// Per-CodecImpl:
//
// We handle per-Codec protocol errors and the like by calling Unbind() on the
// CodecImpl, which fairly soon results in ~CodecImpl async, but does not exit
// the whole devhost process.  We also handle a few per-CodecImpl errors this
// way even though some of those are closer to being caused by per-devhost
// conditions, just in case.
//
// Per-devhost-process:
//
// In contrast, per-devhost error conditions, like the inability to post work to
// the shared_fidl_thread(), are handled by exiting the devhost, because those
// conditions are not really unique to any one CodecImpl.

// "Ordering Domain":
//
// The term "ordering domain" is intended to mean "sequence" when using a sequence-capable
// dispatcher, or "thread" when using a non-sequence-capable dispatcher. Any lingering instances of
// just "thread" can be assumed to actually mean "ordering domain".
//
// Regardless of sequence vs. thread, posted tasks run in posted order and on one thread at a time.
//
// If all remaining async_dispatcher_t(s) are eventually updated to support sequence ops, we'll want
// to update the CodecImpl comments to just say "sequence", but currently saying "sequence" would be
// inaccurate for client code using async::Loop::dispatcher(), so we still say "ordering domain".
//
// There are currently 3 ordering domains:
//   * fidl (1 process-wide)
//     * all FIDL handling/sending + output port activity
//     * non-blocking (intent; may not fully match reality for older CodecImpl client code)
//   * StreamControl (1 per StreamProcessor server)
//     * input port activity
//     * input packets transit this domain
//     * handles stream state transitions such as starting/stopping the up-to-one
//       CodecAdapter-visible stream
//     * coordinates mid-stream buffer reallocation using sequential blocking code
//     * allowed to block
//     * separate instance per CodecImpl instance (per StreamProcessor server)
//   * core codec / InputData (1 process-wide)
//     * this can optionally share with fidl, if certain requirements are met; see
//       SetSharingFidlDomainForCoreCodec
//     * ideally non-blocking
//       * this ideal is subject to caveats however
//         * older CodecImpl client code may not be ideal
//         * FW/HW that's not as capable may demand the CPU spin-wait for long-ish durations (see
//           below)
//         * SW-based codecs don't "block" but do need to use the CPU to process the bulk input data
//           (see below).
//     * SW-based codecs must not call SetSharingFidlDomainForCoreCodec unless the SW-based codec
//       uses separate threads (not visible to CodecImpl) for the bulk decode/encode on the CPU.
//     * new HW-based codecs should consider calling SetSharingFidlDomainForCoreCodec if
//       requirements can be met, as this avoids some thread switching.
//       * If the FW/HW requires any long-duration spin-waits by the CPU subsequent to initial
//         driver initialization, at any time when other streams may be active, consider splitting
//         up those waits with timer-driven polling (or use an interrupt if available from the
//         FW/HW, though this isn't always available unfortunately). Or, don't call
//         SetSharingFidlDomainForCoreCodec so that any such CPU spin-waits are kept off the fidl
//         thread (likely the simpler option, given such FW/HW). This sort of FW/HW is a main reason
//         we retain the option to not call SetSharingFidlDomainForCoreCodec and use separate
//         concurrent core codec ordering domain.
//     * Motivating considerations:
//       * Quick stream switching when a StreamProcessor client cancels an old stream and creates a
//         new stream to replace it.
//       * Non-interference among multiple StreamProcessor servers multiplexing the HW.
//         * not a concern for SW-based StreamProcessor servers as these intentionally run a
//           separate isolated process per StreamProcessor server, aside from overall system CPU
//           load which is not currently mitigated (as is typical for nearly all low-layer media
//           stacks capable of running SW-based codecs fwiw)

// Potential refactoring ideas:
//
// Each odd buffer_lifetime_ordinal value could have an instance of a BufferLifetimeOrdinal class.
// We have enough members like std::unordered_map<uint64_t, stuff> foo_[kPortCount] to make this
// refactor worthwhile. This would allow replacing those members with a single map that owns
// BufferLifetimeOrdinal(s). The ~BufferLifetimeOrdinal would be a nice place to put common ordinal
// cleanup / reset. Current member fields that track aspects of only the latest ordinal wouldn't
// strictly need to go in BufferLifetimeOrdinal, but we could still put them there and clear them
// out when the BufferLifetimeOrdinal is no longer current. Essentially all real streams have few
// concurrently-allocated ordinals, so there's no concern re. wasted space for fields that are only
// needed for the latest ordinal.
//
// CodecBuffer could potentially be created as soon as AddBufferInternal, with the caveat that we'd
// need to be careful not to trust the VMO too much until GetVmoInfo succeeds. This caveat seems
// fairly significant, so keeping AddingBuffer for now.

  // stuck waiting on a client to catch up to an output config that the client

  // discarding message is reached at which point the core codec's mid-stream
  // output config change is cancelled/forgotten when we reset the core codec.
  //
  // In addition, if we're behind, we can catch up by skipping past some
  // messages for future-discarded streams to catch up to non-discarded stream
  // input quicker.  Theoretically we could do even better by having the FIDL
  // thread delete messages previously queued to the StreamControl domain
  // regarding a stream that is now known to be discarded by the FIDL thread,

  //
  // The uint64_t is the buffer_lifetime_ordinal of the buffer. The uint32_t is

  //
  // If the CodecAdapter does support dynamic buffers, the key values correspond
  // to any still-active buffers, which can include buffers with older
  // buffer_lifetime_ordinal. The buffer_index values can be any uint32_t value,
  // depending on the values the client set via StreamProcessor.AddBuffer. For
  // the current buffer_lifetime_ordinal, a buffer_index value can only be
  // reused after the previous buffer with the same buffer_index has been fully
  // removed, which includes removing from this map. For older
  // buffer_lifetime_ordinal values, any AddBuffer with an old
  // buffer_lifetime_ordinal is ignored, and further buffer_index value reuse
  // is therefore impossible.
  //
  // Any buffers with buffer_lifetime_ordinal < buffer_lifetime_ordinal_[port]
  // are pending removal. Buffers with buffer_lifetime_ordinal ==
  // buffer_lifetime_ordinal_[port] can be pending removal if
  // is_dynamic_buffers_[port] is set to true, and the client has sent
  // StreamProcessor.RemoveBuffer.
  //
  // The "pending removal" state is only possible when using dynamic buffers, as
  // non-dynamic buffers mode immediately removes buffers, with the
  // corresponding downside of potentially encountering a VP9 stream that uses
  // show_existing_frame on an old-dimensions frame and dropping that output
  // frame. Such a stream is permitted by the VP9 spec, but non-dynamic buffer
  // mode doesn't support outputting any old-dimensions frames of such a stream.
  // It does however support correctly decoding all the frames, if the
  // CodecAdapter correctly retains old-dimensions reference frames beyond the
  // start of a new buffer_lifetime_ordinal at StreamProcessor layer. For such a
  // stream, assuming correct CodecAdapter behavior wrt non-dynamic buffer mode,
  // all frames that are emitted are correctly decoded, but old-dimensions
  // frames are not emitted, despite the bitstream saying they should be. This
  // would tend to look like a stutter/jank fairly near a dimension switch,
  // though the distance from a prior dimension switch isn't technically
  // constrained by the VP9 bitstream spec. In practice such streams seem to be
  // essentially non-existent outside of test streams. For pre-encoded non-RTC
  // streams, a first new-dimensions frame is typically treated as an
  // intra-coded keyframe with no subsequent references to frames prior to the
  // first new-dimensions frame (for better or worse). At least partly, this may
  // be to avoid requiring the various-dimension pre-encoded streams to be
  // jointly encoded, as that would be substantially more complicated. For RTC
  // streams, typically there's no frame reordering in the first place, so no
  // use of show_existing_frame.
  //
  // All that said, we do want to be able to correctly decode test streams that
  // use show_existing_frames in atypical but still bitstream-spec-valid ways,
  // so that's why we keep some old buffer_lifetime_orinal values in this map
  // until the old frames have been fully dropped by the CodecAdapter. Until
  // then, the CodecAdapter can still refer to the old buffers in an output
  // packet, and we'll still emit that output packet via
  // StreamProcessor.OnOutputPacket.
  //
  // Buffers in this map remain alive until either CodecImpl is deleted, or
  // ZX_VMO_ZERO_CHILDREN is seen on CodecBuffer.parent_vmo_. There is no time
  // bound on how long an entry here can remain pending removal/deletion,
  // because some video bitstream formats don't limit how long a reference frame
  // can remain in the set of active reference frames (for example VP9). In
  // addition the codec could be paused in the middle of the stream, blocked on
  // availability of an output buffer or availability of more input data.
  //
  // When StreamProcessor.RemoveBuffer is used, the CodecBuffer here will have a
  // RemoveBuffer completion attached, which will run when removal is done. If
  // is_dynamic_buffers_[port] is set to true, the RemoveBuffer also causes the
  // buffer to become pending removal, even if the buffer has
