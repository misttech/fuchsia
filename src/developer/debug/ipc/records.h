  // In practice, this is a 32 bit integer with the most significant byte identifying the originator
  // of this filter. The remaining 24 bits are reserved for the clients. Clients typically never
  // install more than a few (< 10) filters, even in extended sessions. The filter will be rejected
  // with an error if a client attempts to use a value that would encroach on the most significant
  // byte. The client value is never modified.
  //
  // This has two primary purposes:
  //
  //   1. Allow feed-forward flows from the clients. IDs are assigned by clients at filter creation
  //      time.
  //     1a. The lone exception to this is the NotifyFilterCreated event from the backend, which
  //         will construct a filter with an originator value of kAgent. See the notification for
  //         more details.
  //   2. Provide uniqueness across all clients and the backend.
  //
  // In general, this is always needed to disambiguate which client(s) should take action based on a
  // filter matching resulting in either a {Component,Process}Starting notification or as the result
  // of an UpdateFilter request matching some non-zero number of processes.
  //
  // The NotifyFilterCreated event is typically sent as a result of a client installing a filter
  // with the |recursive| option. When a match for this filter is found, the backend will construct
  // a new filter with the (typically component moniker) information and send the event to all
  // clients along with the identifier of the original filter. Clients can use this, along with
  // their respectively allocated mask, to determine when they are responsible for keeping track of
  // this new filter.
