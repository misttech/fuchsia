class AsyncSocket:
    """Represents an async socket.

    In 99% of cases it is recommended to use this instead of the standard fuchsia-controller Socket
    object. This has built-in support for handling waits.

    In the remaining 1% of cases it may be useful for the user to do a one-off attempt at reading a
    socket directly and immediately exiting in the event that ZX_ERR_SHOULD_WAIT is encountered.
    Such a case would likely involve adding some custom behavior to existing async code, like
    registering custom wakers. Another case would be where the user is _only_ writing to the socket,
    as writes in AsyncSocket are also synchronous and wrap Socket.write directly.

    Args:
        socket: The socket which will be asynchronously readable.
        waker: (Optional) the HandleWaker implementation (defaults to GlobalHandleWaker).

    Raises:

    If you are running this socket in a task using `read_all()` be sure there is
    only one instance of `read_all()` running, else this will raise an exception
    in the case where one attempts to run `read()` or `read_all()` after this
    has been initiated.

    Keep in mind that if you run `read_all()` and place it on a task in the
    executor, and you do not yield to the executor, and then attempt to run
    `read_all()`, then it will be the task itself that will fail, because the
    read invocation will be reached before yielding to the async task, so you
    cannot solely rely on this to catch potential deadlocks.
