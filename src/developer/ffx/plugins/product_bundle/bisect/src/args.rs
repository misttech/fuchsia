  This parameter type (from-success, to-failure) refers to the product bundle version.

  Steps to retrieve this information depends on which product bundle is being bisected,
  but it can always be retrieved from the product bundle itself by running:

    VALIDATION SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS:
  If a --script is provided, it will be executed for each bisection step.
  The script will receive the following arguments:
    --pb <path>  : The absolute path to the assembled product bundle for the current step.

  The script must exit with one of the following codes:
    0          : Pass (The bug is NOT present in this version)
    1-124      : Fail (The bug IS present in this version)
    125        : Skip (The PB was untestable, e.g. failed to flash)
    128+       : Abort (A critical infrastructure failure occurred)

    // 1. Bisect the core.vim3 product bundle between two provided versions.

// 2. Automate bisection with a validation script.
// Create a file called `validate.sh` with the following content:

#!/bin/bash
# Extract the PB path from the arguments
while [[ \"$#\" -gt 0 ]]; do
    case $1 in
        --pb) PB_PATH=\"$2\"; shift 2 ;;

# Flash the device with the assembled product bundle
ffx target flash \"$PB_PATH\"
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo \"Failed to flash, skipping...\"
    exit 125 # Skip
fi

# <this is where the test code goes>
# e.g., ffx test run ...

# Return 0 for Pass, 1 for Fail
exit 0

// Then pass the script to the bisection tool:
ffx product-bundle bisect core.vim3 \\
    --from-success 29.20250826.6.1 \\
    --to-failure 29.20250905.6.1 \\
