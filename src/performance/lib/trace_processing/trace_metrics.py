        can be as simple as a list of event names, or a full regexp. Filters are applied with OR
        semantics, so if an event passes any filter, it will appear in the final trace model.

        If your metrics processor requires no events, return the empty set.

        Metrics may be calculated from kernel scheduler records, named trace events or a combination
        of the two. In order to reduce processing time and memory usage, an implementation must
        provide for excluding unneeded trace events.

        ** Please use `event_patterns` if at all reasonable. **

        Providing a precise set of event patterns enables much more significant RAM savings.
        That said, some metrics require the presence of "flows" in the traces that are made up of
        multiple duration events and flow events all working in concert. In those cases, it can be
        onerous and brittle to specify the full list of events needed for a metric and listing one
        or more categories by name is acceptable.

        As filters are applied using OR semantics, it is not necessary to include an event by both
        category AND by providing a pattern that matches it by name. For the same reason, an event
        cannot be excluded by declining to reference its category here; if the name matches one of
        the provided `event_patterns`, the event will be filtered in.

        Thus, returning the empty set does _not_ filter out all events. Rather, it defers filtering
        entirely to `event_patterns`.

        Scheduler records cannot be filtered out and will always be present in the traces provided
        for metrics processing.
