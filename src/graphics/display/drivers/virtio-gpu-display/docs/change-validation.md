# Validating driver changes in QEMU

## High-level process

Use the steps below to validate a code change in QEMU. Each of the steps below
references one of the procedures defined in the following section.

1. Start a QEMU emulator running a Fuchsia build.

2. Extract the virtual display resolution from the emulator configuration.

3. Launch the Fuchsia tool `display-tool info`. Check that the output includes
   one display whose resolution matches the virtual display resolution.

4. Take a screenshot and check that it looks as expected. `workbench_eng`
   products show a Virtcon console with a Fuchsia logo ASCII art made out of `f`
   letters.

5. Launch the Fuchsia tool `display-tool squares`.

6. Take a screenshot. Check that it contains four colored squares, which may
   overlap.

7. Check for errors and inconsistencies in the driver's output in the serial
   logs.

8. Check for ERROR entries (software implementation errors) in the serial logs.

9. Check for ERROR entries (software implementation errors) in the Fuchsia
   system logs.

## Procedures for interacting with the emulator

### Launching a QEMU instance running a Fuchsia build

Steps:

1. Ensure the emulator is stopped: `ffx emu stop --all`

2. Build the project (may take a few minutes): `fx build`

3. Create the logs storage directory: `mkdir -p local`

4. Delete any old logs: `rm -f local/logs.qemu.*`

5. Start the emulator, saving QEMU tool logs:
   `ffx emu start --engine qemu --headless --log local/logs.qemu`

6. Wait for `ffx` to exit. The last output line should be: `Emulator is ready.`

7. Wait for the emulator ffx connection to stabilize: `ffx target wait`

`ffx emu start` command arguments breakdown:

* `--engine qemu` required, as the default engine is FEMU (Fuchsia Emulator)

* `--log local/logs.qemu` sets the QEMU log path; the serial log path is
  computed by appending `.serial` to this value, obtaining
  `local/logs.qemu.serial`

* `--headless` optional in a graphical environment

### Launching a Fuchsia shell tool in the emulator

Use the steps below to run shell tools in the emulator, such as
`display-tool`.

1. Run a package server (blocks; needs its own terminal):
   `fx serve --foreground`

2. Wait for the command above to output a line similar to:
   `Serving repository '/ssd/fuchsia/out/x64/amber-files' over address '[::]:8083'.`

3. Run the command: `ffx target ssh -- {COMMAND} [{ARGUMENTS...}]`.
   Example: `ffx target ssh -- display-tool info`

4. If starting the command fails and the output contains
   `Cannot create child process: -25 (ZX_ERR_NOT_FOUND)`, wait a few seconds for
   the VM to connect to the package server, and try again.

### Obtaining emulator configuration details

Options:

* `ffx emu show --cmd` produces a compact description of the emulated hardware
* `ffx emu show` outputs all available information

### Collecting logs from the Fuchsia build

Example commands for analyzing serial logs:

* `grep --context=3 "virtio-gpu-display" local/logs.qemu.serial`
* `grep --context=3 "ERROR" local/logs.qemu.serial`

Example sequence of commands for saving and analyzing system logs:

1. `ffx log dump > local/logs.qemu.fuchsia`
2. `grep --context=3 "ERROR" local/logs.qemu.fuchsia`

Tool dependencies:

* `ffx emu start` configures QEMU to save serial logs at a predetermined
  location. The example `ffx emu start --engine qemu --log local/logs.qemu`
  saves serial logs at `local/logs.qemu.serial`. These logs are available even
  if the ffx connection to the emulator does not work.

* `ffx log dump` requires a working ffx connection.

### Obtaining a screenshot from the emulator

Sequence of steps for looking at the emulator screen.

1. `ffx emu screenshot --output local/screenshot.qemu.png`
2.  Read the binary file `local/screenshot.qemu.png` with a tool that allows you
    to interpret its visual content.

Tool dependencies:

* `ffx emu screenshot` takes a screenshot using emulator infrastructure, and
  does not rely on any software running inside the emulator.
